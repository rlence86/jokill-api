This project is the backend service for the Jokill application.

It is built using Spring Boot.

To build it you just have to run
````
mvn clean install
````

To start the application listening on 8080 just run
````
mvn spring-boot:run
````

Currently this is an empty project so there's not much to see here at this moment.
